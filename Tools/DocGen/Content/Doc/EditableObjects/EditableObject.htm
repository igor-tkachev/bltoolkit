<p class="j">
<b>EditableObject</b> is an object that provides functionality to commit and rollback changes to itself.
After verifying the accuracy of changes made to the object, you can accept the changes
using the <b>AcceptChanges</b> method of the object, which will set the <b>Current</b> field values
to be the <b>Original</b> values. The <b>RejectChanges</b> method rejects all changes made to the object
since <b>AcceptChanges</b> was last called. The <b>IsDirty</b> property gets a value that indicates
whether the object has changed.

BLToolkit allows implementing the same functionality by inheriting your object
from the BLToolkit <b>EditableObject</b> base class and replacing editable members with abstract properties.
