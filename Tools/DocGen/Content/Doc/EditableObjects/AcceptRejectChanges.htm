After verifying the accuracy of changes made to the object, you can accept the changes
using the <b>AcceptChanges</b> method of the object, which will set the <b>Current</b> field values
to be the <b>Original</b> values. The <b>RejectChanges</b> method rejects all changes made to the object
since <b>AcceptChanges</b> was last called.
